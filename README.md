#  Interactive CNN Visualizer with ReLU & Loss Tracking

## üîç What It Is  
An interactive, animated visualizer that demonstrates how a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** learns to match a target output by adjusting its filter weights using **gradient descent** ‚Äî step by step.

##  What I've Built

###  1.  5√ó5 Input Matrix
- Binary pattern (1s and 0s)  
- Represents a tiny grayscale image or signal

###  2.  3√ó3 Learnable Filter
- Starts with initialized weights  
- Moves across 9 positions (3√ó3 output) using a sliding window  
- Performs convolution on each patch

### 3.  3√ó3 Target Output Matrix
- The CNN‚Äôs goal is to learn filter weights that produce this exact output from the input

###  4. Forward + Backward Passes
At each position, the filter:
- Computes a dot product with the 3√ó3 input patch (**forward pass**)  
- Compares the result with the target value  
- Calculates the error (`prediction - target`)  
- Uses the error to update the gradient for each filter weight (**backward pass**)

###  5. Loss Calculation (MSE)
- After each full sweep over the input:
  - Compute **Mean Squared Error** over all 9 outputs
  - Track the loss over time and **plot it live**

###  6. Weight Updates (Gradient Descent)
- After each full forward + backward pass:
  - Average the accumulated gradients
  - Update each filter weight using:  
    ```
    w = w - Œ∑ ‚ãÖ avg_gradient
    ```
    where `Œ∑` is the learning rate
